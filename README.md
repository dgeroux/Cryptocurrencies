# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview:

 An investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, I created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data I'm working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output, I've decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I've decided on a clustering algorithm. I'll use data visualizations to share the findings.
